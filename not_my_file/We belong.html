                        [Intro]
        Ooh-ooh
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

        [Verse 1]
        I've tried to tell you
        So many times this feelings of mine
        But it's not that easy
        Letting you know
        How I love you so

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Complete me, you complete me
        I've never felt this way
        Complete me, you complete me
        Like words and melody

        [Chorus]
        Don't you know that we both belong, baby?
        Don't you know that we will last forever?
        Don't you know that we both belong?
        I knew it from the start, we belong
        Ooh-ooh

        [Verse 2]
        Hoping that someday
        For that hello, just a simple hello
        And maybe tomorrow
        I'm the reason you'll smile
        And you make my day

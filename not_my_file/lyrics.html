        Wondering where you are tonight
        Maybe you're that distant star
        How I want you right here by my side

        Now I see your face above
        Could you take me where you are?
        Unafraid no matter what may come
        Waiting for the hour of those many nights

        When you wake up in the storm
        Trees will all be standing tall
        I come to you, you'll never be alone

        When your hopes fall apart
        Night is cold, day is dark
        I give my heart, it's right where you belong
        Right where you belong
        Right where you belong

        And we'll meet across the sky
        So together we will fly
        You're so near to me, you'll never be afar
        Wanting every hour of those many nights

        When you wake up in the storm
        Trees will all be standing tall
        I come to you, you'll never be alone

        When your hopes fall apart
        Night is cold, day is dark
        I give my heart, it's right where you belong
        Right where you belong
        Right where you belong

        Loving every hour of those many nights

        When you wake up in the storm
        Trees will all be standing tall
        I come to you, you'll never be alone (come to you, oh, you'll never be alone)

        When your hopes fall apart (fall apart)
        Night is cold, day is dark (night is cold, day is dark)
        I give my heart, it's right where you belong
        Right where you belong
        Right where you belong</pre>
